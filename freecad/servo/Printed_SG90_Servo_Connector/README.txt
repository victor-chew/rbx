# Summary

The SG90/9G servo is very popular - and every time I see it in a project (including [my own](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1678007)) the little white plastic connector that comes with the servo is used (because the connector has tiny teeth that are not printable).

For my next project I wanted to use this servo but wanted to connect my part directly to the servo - so I made this. 

If you zoom in you will see this isn't a round hole, inside there are tiny 0.5mm teeth.

Connecting this to the servo requires some force but it works really well.

Obviously this isn't a standalone object, this is for you to use in your designs to connect a servo, I've included the STL I printed to test the connector and the SketchUp source file.

Also obviously, you need a well calibrated printer to print 0.5mm features, so test-print it before doing anything that depends on it.

Note: it works if printed with the connector on the top or bottom of your print, havn't got it to work if the connector is on a side wall.

If you print it on the bottom and you squish the first layer you may need to carefully file the outer circle to get the servo to fit, be careful not to file the little teeth inside the connector. 

Video showing how well it connects at https://youtu.be/A9TxGgDMwbg (there's a screw hole in the connector but it's not used in the video) 

The test print was sliced with Cura and printed in PLA on my Robo3D R1+
